# Gaia Calendar
## The what now?
I'm tired of following the same religious-driven arbitrary calendar. For the ones that feel the same as me, I've created a new, non-religious-driven arbitrary calendar: the **Gaia Calendar**, named after Gaia, the greek "Personification of the Earth" (for poetic, non-religious purposes).

## How the hell does that work?
For now, you have to know that the only things we are preserving are the hours in a day (24) and the number of days in the year (365). We won't even use the gregorian year system, so we are technically NOT in 2023. This is not the most practical date system that you would come up with in a casual conversation, though.

## Human Era / Holocene
> The Holocene calendar, also known as the Holocene Era or Human Era (HE), is a year numbering system that adds exactly 10,000 years to the currently dominant (AD/BC or CE/BCE) numbering scheme, placing its first year near the beginning of the Holocene geological epoch and the Neolithic Revolution, when humans shifted from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture and fixed settlements.

Instead of basing our year system on the supposed birth of **a man**, why not base it on the birth of **Humanity**? It's as arbitrary as the former, but, at least for me, it's more meaningful. And heck, it's not even that difficult: just add 10,000 years to the current gregorian year, and you're done.

## Sabbats
This has NOTHING to do with the abrahamic religions' sabbaths, nope. I'm referring to the eight festivities from the pagan **Wheel of the Year**:

* **Yule** / Midwinter / Winter Solstice
* **Imbolc** / Candlemas
* **Ostara** / Spring Equinox
* **Beltane** / May Eve
* **Litha** / Summer Solstice
* **Lughnasadh** / Lammas
* **Mabon** / Autumn Equinox
* **Samhain**

Although they certainly have witchy-religious connotations, they are actually based on the four **seasons** and the middle points between them, which I think it's better than having two roman emperors' names as months. Further info for each sabbat will be added soon.

## Eneastra
This is something new that I've created, that may or may not be practical and/or acceptable and/or liked. 

You know the
> God created the world in seven days.

thing?

I say fuck it, for the atheists' sake. No more seven days on a week. Hell, not even a "week" anymore.

The word **eneastra** comes from "ene" (nine) and "astra" (star, although more like "celestial body" in this case). It's the very original name I came with after deciding the new week would have nine days named after nine celestial bodies, adding "gaia" at the end.

Those celestial bodies are, in this order: the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and the Moon. So, the nine days of an eneastra are Sungaia, Mergaia, Vengaia, Margaia, Jupgaia, Satgaia, Urgaia, Nepgaia and Moongaia. 

Sungaia, Jupgaia and Moongaia are rest days. That makes it a 3:1 ratio of working to resting days, but we have that little silly rest day in the middle of the eneastra, which might be very needed. So, if you wanted to survive through an eneastra, you would have to work 3 days, rest one day, work another 3 days and then rest 2 days.
